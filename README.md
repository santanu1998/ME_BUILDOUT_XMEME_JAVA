# XMeme

### XMeme is a simple backend web application where users can post and see memes.

### During the course of this project,

1. Built XMeme by writing necessary GET and POST APIs for fetching and posting the memes.

2. Built the backend application from scratch using a spring starter template and stored/retrieved the data from MongoDB.

3. Tested the application functionality.
